McStamm Wedding

This is the first website that I have coded and then published.  I used a combination of CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox for most page layouts.  

All of the pages except for the index page are responsive down to mobile phones.  I could not figure out how to get the main page to be 
mobile responsive.  When attempting to turn the <div> gridbox into a flexbox amd then stack the elements into one column, I would only be
able to see two images.  The other images would show up in the HTML source code, but the page wouldn't scroll past two, nor show a scroll
bar at all.

This is my wedding website for myself and my fiance.
